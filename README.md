  - full/incremental releases for generic multi-datacenter application sets
  - build and deployments without writing scripts, compact declarative tobe-specifications
  - align with specific technologies, not replacing with its own
  - release planning control
  - multi-repository codebase management, svn/git repositories
  - multi-datacenter geterogenious environment management, flexible but controlled configurations
  - enforce storing codebase in repositories for buildable, configuration files and database modification files
  - enforce storing all artefacts required for automatic deployment in well-defined distributive packages
  - multi-team environment
  - messaging integrations
